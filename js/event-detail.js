A strange portal appeared, leading to Enigmara—a realm of endless mirages and darkness where evil spirits feed on fear and chaos. The creatures of Enigmara began seeping through the portal, causing despair. The Guardians discovered a prophecy: "To close the portal, the Guardians must venture into the Mirage of Shadows—Where truth is illusion and illusion is truth." Only the one who finds the Key of Enigmara can restore the balance of worlds. The Guardians embarked on this journey, leaving clues, riddles, and symbols. You are the Seekers of Light—chosen to retrace their journey, solve the mysteries, and uncover the Key to close the Portal of Enigmara before darkness consumes the world.',
